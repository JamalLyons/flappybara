C++ Raylib Template with CMake

This is my opinionated template for learning C++ using raylib.
I use the c-lion IDE to program C++ code and to run the Cmake 
build commands.

The template includes the following features out of the box:

- c++ 26
- raylib 5.5
- Audio resource manager
- Cmake build system
- Utility functions
